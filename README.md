<h1>About the assignment</h1>

For the assignment, two path finding algorithms had to be developed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. GRASP and Simulated Annealing algorithms were chosen by my team. My personal contribution to the project can be found in `Investigating TSP.ipynb` file, GRASP section. The project was developed using Jupyter Notebook.
